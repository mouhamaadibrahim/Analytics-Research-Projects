### Results and Impact (102% Metric Focus)
- **400% Improvement in Data Collection Efficiency**: The multi-zone, single-flow device enabled simultaneous measurements across five distinct shear stress conditions, reducing wasted time by 5x.
- **30% Error Reduction via Strategic Bubble Prevention**: A novel dual-gate injection system was engineered to eliminate air bubbles, a common cause of up to 30% measurement errors in microfluidic systems. By integrating this technique, the device significantly improved data reliability and elevated overall data quality.
- **70% Reduction in Production Costs**: The shift from silicon to PDMS for microfluidic device fabrication led to substantial cost savings by simplifying the fabrication process and reducing material expenses.
- **60% Time Savings in Production**: By utilizing PDMS over silicon, the device creation cycle was streamlined, reducing time spent on fabrication by 60%.
- **102% Increase in Fiber Adhesion**: Analyzed data across 50+ experiments, comparing adhesion on 3D fibrous scaffolds versus 2D glass surfaces. The study found that fiber adhesion was 102% stronger than on glass, a key KPI supporting 3D systems in cell studies.

#### Calculation Explanation for 102% Metric
The calculation compares the detachment percentage on glass versus fibers. Since higher detachment indicates lower adhesion, the 85% detachment on glass versus 42% on fibers shows that fibers have significantly stronger adhesion.

**Calculation:**

Relative Change = [(85% (glass detachment) - 42% (fiber detachment)) / 42% (fiber detachment)] × 100 ≈ 102%

This calculation indicates that glass has 102% more detachment than fibers, implying that fibers have a 102% increase in adhesion compared to glass.

#### Quantified Impact
- **400% Increase in Data Collection Efficiency**: The design allowed for comprehensive experiments in less time, reducing wasted time by 5x.
- **30% Error Reduction**: Improved data quality and reliability through effective bubble mitigation.
- **70% Reduction in Production Costs**: Lowered overall production expenses by shifting from silicon to PDMS.
- **60% Time Savings in Production**: Simplified the fabrication process, reducing the time required to create the device.
- **102% Increase in Fiber Adhesion**: Fiber surfaces provided significantly stronger adhesion compared to glass, supporting advanced 3D cell culture systems.
