# Research-Analytics-Portfolio by Mouhamad Ibrahim, PhD

Welcome to my research-driven analytics portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of research projects focused on data analysis, sensor optimization, and bioimpedance modeling conducted during my PhD and post-doc work. Notably, one of my research publications, ["Geometric parameters optimization of planar interdigitated electrodes for bioimpedance spectroscopy"](https://dimensions.altmetric.com/details/81105616#score), was ranked in the top 25% by Altmetric, reflecting the significant impact and reach of my work in the field.

**Industry Adoption and Impact**  
Through data-driven analysis, the optimal ratio was determined to be 0.66, resulting in significant improvements in sensor performance. The model was validated through simulations and experiments, leading to industry adoption and patenting by 4 industry leaders. Details of this adoption can be found in the ["Proof of Impact"](link_to_be_added_later) repository, which will highlight the real-world impact of these contributions.

## PhD Research: Bioimpedance Modeling and Sensor Optimization

### 1. Engineering Models to Determine Optimal Sensor Design (S/W = 0.66)

This section covers the analytical and experimental work that led to the identification of the optimal ratio for sensor geometry (S/W = 0.66), resulting in a 65% improvement in analysis effectiveness.

#### Project Overview
The primary objective was to optimize the design of planar interdigitated electrodes for bioimpedance spectroscopy. This involved:
- Developing a mathematical model to determine the ideal gap (S) to width (W) ratio.
- Validating the model through simulations and experimental data.

#### Mathematical Modeling and Insights
The bioimpedance model was developed by analyzing physiological characteristics as electrical components. The key steps involved:
- Deriving impedance equations based on electrode geometry.
- Conducting simulations to identify the optimal sensor configuration.
- The results demonstrated that the S/W ratio of 0.66 provided the best performance, expanding the analysis band and reducing the cutoff frequency.

### 2. Calculation of the 65% Improvement in Analysis Effectiveness

The analysis band was expanded by 65% by comparing the optimal sensor (S/W = 0.66) with other configurations. The calculation process included:
- Determining the cutoff frequency for each configuration.
- Calculating the analysis band as the difference between the maximum frequency and the cutoff frequency.
- The 65% improvement was the highest observed across the tested sensors.

#### Calculation Process
- **Optimized Sensor (S/W = 0.66):** F(Low) = 1.2 × 10⁵ Hz  
  Analysis Band = 9.88 × 10⁶ Hz
- **Non-Optimized Sensor (S/W = 4):** F(Low) = 40 × 10⁵ Hz  
  Analysis Band = 6 × 10⁶ Hz

**Improvement Calculation:**  
The analysis band increased from 6 × 10⁶ Hz (non-optimized) to 9.88 × 10⁶ Hz (optimized), leading to an approximate 65% enhancement. The calculation is:  
Improvement (%) = [(9.88 × 10⁶ - 6 × 10⁶) / 6 × 10⁶] × 100 ≈ 65%

### 3. Calculation of the 18% Sensitivity Improvement

This section documents the improvement in sensor sensitivity achieved by reducing measurement errors:
- The optimized sensor showed a relative change in conductivity of 4%, compared to 22% for non-optimized sensors.
- The difference in error rates (22% - 4%) equates to an 18% improvement in sensitivity.

#### Experiment Details
- Conductivity measurements were compared against standard values (0.7 S/m).
- The optimized sensor (Capteur 5) outperformed non-optimized configurations (Capteurs 7 and 8) by providing more accurate readings.
