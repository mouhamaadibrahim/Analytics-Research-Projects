# Research-Analytics-Portfolio by Mouhamad Ibrahim, PhD

Welcome to my research-driven analytics portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of research projects focused on data analysis, sensor optimization, and bioimpedance modeling conducted during my PhD and post-doc work.

## Featured Projects

### 1. Engineering Models to Determine Optimal Sensor Design (S/W = 0.66)

This section covers the analytical and experimental work that led to the identification of the optimal ratio for sensor geometry (S/W = 0.66), resulting in a 65% improvement in analysis effectiveness.

#### Project Overview
The primary objective was to optimize the design of planar interdigitated electrodes for bioimpedance spectroscopy. This involved:
- Developing a mathematical model to determine the ideal gap (S) to width (W) ratio.
- Validating the model through simulations and experimental data.

#### Mathematical Modeling and Insights
The bioimpedance model was developed by analyzing physiological characteristics as electrical components. The key steps involved:
- Deriving impedance equations based on electrode geometry.
- Conducting simulations to identify the optimal sensor configuration.
- The results demonstrated that the S/W ratio of 0.66 provided the best performance, expanding the analysis band and reducing the cutoff frequency.

### 2. Calculation of the 65% Improvement in Analysis Effectiveness

The analysis band was expanded by 65% by comparing the optimal sensor (S/W = 0.66) with other configurations. The calculation process included:
- Determining the cutoff frequency for each configuration.
- Calculating the analysis band as the difference between the maximum frequency and the cutoff frequency.
- The 65% improvement was the highest observed across the tested sensors.

#### Calculation Process
- **Optimized Sensor (S/W = 0.66):** F(Low) = 1.2 × 10⁵ Hz  
  Analysis Band = 9.88 × 10⁶ Hz
- **Non-Optimized Sensor (S/W = 4):** F(Low) = 40 × 10⁵ Hz  
  Analysis Band = 6 × 10⁶ Hz

**Improvement Calculation:**  
Using the non-optimized band in the denominator, the analysis band improved by approximately 65%.

### 3. Calculation of the 18% Sensitivity Improvement

This section documents the improvement in sensor sensitivity achieved by reducing measurement errors:
- The optimized sensor showed a relative change in conductivity of 4%, compared to 22% for non-optimized sensors.
- The difference in error rates (22% - 4%) equates to an 18% improvement in sensitivity.

#### Experiment Details
- Conductivity measurements were compared against standard values (0.7 S/m).
- The optimized sensor (Capteur 5) outperformed non-optimized configurations (Capteurs 7 and 8) by providing more accurate readings.
