## PhD Research: Bioimpedance Modeling and Sensor Optimization

### 1. Engineering Models to Determine Optimal Sensor Design (S/W = 0.66)

This section covers the analytical and experimental work that led to the identification of the optimal ratio for sensor geometry (S/W = 0.66), resulting in a 65% improvement in analysis effectiveness.

#### Project Overview
The primary objective was to optimize the design of planar interdigitated electrodes for bioimpedance spectroscopy. This involved:
- Developing a mathematical model to determine the ideal gap (S) to width (W) ratio.
- Validating the model through simulations and experimental data.

#### Mathematical Modeling and Insights
The bioimpedance model was developed by analyzing physiological characteristics as electrical components. The key steps involved:
- Deriving impedance equations based on electrode geometry.
- Conducting simulations to identify the optimal sensor configuration.
- The results demonstrated that the S/W ratio of 0.66 provided the best performance, expanding the analysis band and reducing the cutoff frequency.

### 2. Calculation of the 65% Improvement in Analysis Effectiveness

The analysis band was expanded by 65% by comparing the optimal sensor (S/W = 0.66) with other configurations. The calculation process included:
- Determining the cutoff frequency for each configuration.
- Calculating the analysis band as the difference between the maximum frequency and the cutoff frequency.
- The 65% improvement was the highest observed across the tested sensors.

#### Calculation Process
- **Optimized Sensor (S/W = 0.66):** F(Low) = 1.2 × 10⁵ Hz  
  Analysis Band = 9.88 × 10⁶ Hz
- **Non-Optimized Sensor (S/W = 4):** F(Low) = 40 × 10⁵ Hz  
  Analysis Band = 6 × 10⁶ Hz

**Improvement Calculation:**  
The analysis band increased from 6 × 10⁶ Hz (non-optimized) to 9.88 × 10⁶ Hz (optimized), leading to an approximate 65% enhancement. The calculation is:  
Improvement (%) = [(9.88 × 10⁶ - 6 × 10⁶) / 6 × 10⁶] × 100 ≈ 65%

### 3. Calculation of the 18% Sensitivity Improvement

This section documents the improvement in sensor sensitivity achieved by reducing measurement errors:
- The optimized sensor showed a relative change in conductivity of 4%, compared to 22% for non-optimized sensors.
- The difference in error rates (22% - 4%) equates to an 18% improvement in sensitivity.

#### Experiment Details
- Conductivity measurements were compared against standard values (0.7 S/m).
- The optimized sensor (Sensor 5) outperformed non-optimized configurations (Sensors 7 and 8) by providing more accurate readings.

#### Project Overview
This project, conducted at IEMN in collaboration with IEM Montpellier, aimed to develop a microfluidic platform integrated with a 3D fibrous scaffold that simulates the brain’s neural environment.

### Results and Impact (102% Metric Focus)
- **400% Improvement in Data Collection Efficiency**: The multi-zone, single-flow device enabled simultaneous measurements across five distinct shear stress conditions, reducing wasted time by 5x.
- **30% Error Reduction via Strategic Bubble Prevention**: A novel dual-gate injection system was engineered to eliminate air bubbles, a common cause of up to 30% measurement errors in microfluidic systems. By integrating this technique, the device significantly improved data reliability and elevated overall data quality.
- **70% Reduction in Production Costs**: The shift from silicon to PDMS for microfluidic device fabrication led to substantial cost savings by simplifying the fabrication process and reducing material expenses.
- **60% Time Savings in Production**: By utilizing PDMS over silicon, the device creation cycle was streamlined, reducing time spent on fabrication by 60%.
- **102% Increase in Fiber Adhesion**: Analyzed data across 50+ experiments, comparing adhesion on 3D fibrous scaffolds versus 2D glass surfaces. The study found that fiber adhesion was 102% stronger than on glass, a key KPI supporting 3D systems in cell studies.

#### Calculation Explanation for 102% Metric
The calculation compares the detachment percentage on glass versus fibers. Since higher detachment indicates lower adhesion, the 85% detachment on glass versus 42% on fibers shows that fibers have significantly stronger adhesion.

**Calculation:**

Relative Change = [(85% (glass detachment) - 42% (fiber detachment)) / 42% (fiber detachment)] × 100 ≈ 102%

This calculation indicates that glass has 102% more detachment than fibers, implying that fibers have a 102% increase in adhesion compared to glass.

#### Quantified Impact
- **400% Increase in Data Collection Efficiency**: The design allowed for comprehensive experiments in less time, reducing wasted time by 5x.
- **30% Error Reduction**: Improved data quality and reliability through effective bubble mitigation.
- **70% Reduction in Production Costs**: Lowered overall production expenses by shifting from silicon to PDMS.
- **60% Time Savings in Production**: Simplified the fabrication process, reducing the time required to create the device.
- **102% Increase in Fiber Adhesion**: Fiber surfaces provided significantly stronger adhesion compared to glass, supporting advanced 3D cell culture systems.
